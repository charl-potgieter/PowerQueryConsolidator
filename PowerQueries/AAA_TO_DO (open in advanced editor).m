/*

Create metadata for fn_FieldNamesDataVersusSchemaCheck

Add github link in both functions metadata


What is the best way to hand field name conflicts between source and folder view, e.g. if there is a name field in the source data
 - Maybe check for comflicts
 - Create an optional paramater to be added to the source folder

Work on github readme
